A Test Kitchen Provisioner for Salt

The provider works by generating a salt-minion config, creating pillars based on attributes in .kitchen.yml & calling salt-call.

This provider has been tested against the Ubuntu boxes running in vagrant/virtualbox & vagrant-lxc boxes on Ubuntu.

## Installation & Setup
You'll need the test-kitchen & kitchen-salt gem's installed in your system, along with kitchen-vagrant or some other suitable driver for test-kitchen.  Please see the {file:docs/INTRODUCTION.md}.

## Provisioner Options
More details on all the configuration optins are in {file:docs/provisioner_options.md}

## Requirements
You'll need a driver box that is supported by the SaltStack [bootstrap](https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap) system.

## Continuous Integration & Testing
PR's and other changes should validated using Travis-CI, kitchen-docker, multiple state dependencies, the modified version of kitchen-salt and the latest version of test-kitchen.
